<h2>Jack Henderson</h2>
	<p>We were lost starting our new addition on our own, but Tekton provided every solution we needed! From the foundation to the walls they helped every step of the way. </p>

<h2>Samantha Blackwell</h2>
	<p>Tekton is amazing! They helped us find landscapers even though we weren't bringing our business to them. Honest and trustworthy people. </p>

<h2>Hannah Mayland</h2>
	<p>Starting a rennovation and we found ourselves in way over our head. Thankfully Tekton helped us with every <br>hole and patch in the walls and painted too! Couldn't have made it happen without them. </p>
