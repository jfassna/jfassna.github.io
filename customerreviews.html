<h2>Jack Henderson</h2>
	<p>We were lost starting our new addition on our own, but Tekton provided every solution we needed! From the foundation to the walls they helped every step of the way. </p>

<h2>Samantha Blackwell</h2>
	<p>Tekton is amazing! They helped us find landscapers even though we weren't bringing our business to them. Honest and trustworthy people. </p>

<h2>Hannah Mayland</h2>
	<p>Starting a rennovation and we found ourselves in way over our head. Thankfully Tekton helped us with every <br>hole and patch in the walls and painted too! Couldn't have made it happen without them. </p>

<h2>Bryce Williams</h2>
	<p>When we were deciding who should pour the slab for the expansion at my <a href="https://www.1stsource.com/locations/lafayette-cascada-banking-center/" target=_blank> office</a>, we were unsure with who to go to. But after speaking with the employees at Tekton we had our minds made up <br> They were so helpful and directed us to exactly how we should go about it. Honest and amazing people throughout the whole process!</p>
